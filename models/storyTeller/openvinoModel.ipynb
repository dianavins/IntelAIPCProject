As they skipped along its vibrant pathway adorned with multicolored flags fluttering cheerily, Sarah asked, 'Maria, do you know how bridges stand strong despite all the cars going over them?'

There, they learned about the various parts of the bridge – abutments, piers, deck, trusses...it seemed almost alive! Each part played a crucial role just like cells in our bodies.
