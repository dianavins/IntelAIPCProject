STORY TELLING MODEL IS A FINE TUNED, ZERO SHOT LEARNING MODEL

Model: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B

Fine tuning dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ajibawa-2023/Children-Stories-Collection?row=20

Prompt:

Write an educational story (3-5 paragraphs) targeted at young children using simple words. The story should be inspired from this text snippet: {}. The story should have the following features: - Science integration: embed basic science concepts within the story, explaining them through the characters' adventures and discoveries. - Characters and dialogue: create memorable characters who engage in meaningful conversations, helping to explain and explore the science concepts. - Unexpected twist: conclude with a twist that doesn't resolve as hoped, but leaves a clear lesson about life and science.

The kids have the option to tell the model what they're interested in for the model to make a story off of it
